-An interface, in Java terms, specifies methods that a particular class that implements the interface must implement

-The interface yhat you´re creating yourself is abstract and that means that there is no actual code for any of the methods,
you only supply the actual method names and parameters. The actual code still goes in the actual class that you´re creating

-The idea is to use an interfac to provide a common behavior that can be used by several classes by having them all implement
the same interface

-It´s a way to stardardize the way a particularset of classes is used
